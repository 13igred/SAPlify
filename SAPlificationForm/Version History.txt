V1.1 - Release 9/11/2021
	First major update
	This updates removes the program's requirement to access emails and 
	instead uses SharePoint's API to request information directly.

	This was a fairly large change in program process - and enables any 
	Pepsico employee to run this app and process jobs. 
	
	The major goal for the next update is to use Windows Credentials to log
	into SAP without requiring the user to input any additional data.

	First release
	Program is designed to download and read an input file
	in the form of a .txt file from outlook.

	The file contains information nessacary to process a VBA macro for SAP
	This program inputs the file contents into an excel spreadsheet and 
	executes the VBA macro.

	Once this is done the program looks for the next file in the email list.
	In addition the program will open SAP when provided with suitable 
	credentials.
